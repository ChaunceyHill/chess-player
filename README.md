I am building a chess game with a basic engine


Currently I have built the starting position of chess and that is all.  The steps following steps are what I'll do next in order
1) Be able to apply a move
2) Verify if a move is a legal/legitmate move
3) Only apply a move if it is legal
4) Take user input for making moves for one side
5) Take a random move of the possible moves the computer can make and return one
      Doing this step won't really add much value to the final product but it will allow me to get work done on the playing chess
      side of things before I have to worry about making a working engine
6) Implement all rules of the game and ensure they work properly
7) Work on Engine, maybe make a real gui
